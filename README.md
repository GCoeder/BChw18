Steps to send a transaction (each step number represents the picture file number):
1. First create or open a wallet from which you will send your transaction
    - Here I have used the mnemonic phrase to access my ganache addresses and selected the address as my base wallet
2. Here you can now see that my address is the same in my crypto as the address above in ganache 
    - this wallet currently has a balance of 100 ETH ready to send
3. In the "To Address" line put the address of the desired wallet you want to send the transaction to as well as the amount in the "Amount" line
4. After you hit send you can see under transactions the ETH sent, the transaction hash, and the gas fee used.
